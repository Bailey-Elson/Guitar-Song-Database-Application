## Brief 
#### Objective:
To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.

#### Requiremenst:
* Trello Board
* Relational database used to store data persistently for the project, this database needs to have at least 2 tables in it
* ERD diagram modeling the relationship
* Risk Assessment
* Clear Documentation from a design phase describing the architecture you will use for you project
* functional CRUD application created in Python
* Fully designed test suites
* A functioning front-end website and integrated APIâ€™s, using Flask.
* Code fully integrated into a Version Control System using the Feature-Branch model which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine

## Architecture 
#### Entity Relationship Diagrams

![A picture of my ERD diagram](https://i.imgur.com/j2NkMcB.png)

The above ERD shows my database structure. I will be using three tables(Songs, Chords and Chords_Songs), With a many to many relationship between the Songs table and Chords_Songs table and also between the Chords table and the Chords_Songs table. The Chords_Songs table is a joining table between the other two tables using both their primary keys as foriegn keys.

#### Application Flow Chart

###### Original Flow Chart

The above flow chart is the original flow chart plan for my application and shows the basic application structure plan at the beginning of the project. Each dotted box represents a differnet page on the application. All the pages excluding the main song page and main chord page will access the database to create, read, update or delete data.

###### End Flow Chart

The above flow chart is the end flow chart for my application. The additions and altercations have been outlined in red. I firstly added two search funtions one for searching songs that contain a certain chord and the other is for searching chords within a certain song. I also removed the update chord function and replaced it with an add a chord to an existing song.

## Testing

For my testing i will be using the pytest and coverage modules within python, the tests will be written in pytest using python and then 

My Testing ism split into two differnt types:
    * URL Testing
    * Database Testing
    
#### URL Testing
