## Entity Relationship Diagrams

![A picture of my ERD diagram](https://i.imgur.com/j2NkMcB.png)

The above ERD shows my database structure. I will be using three tables(Songs, Chords and Chords_Songs), With a many to many relationship between the Songs table and Chords_Songs table and also between the Chords table and the Chords_Songs table. The Chords_Songs table is a joining table between the other two tables using both their primary keys as foriegn keys.
